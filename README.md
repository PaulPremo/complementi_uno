# biometric app code

Hi guys, this is the file where you can leave a greeting or suggestions.
Please clone the repository and make pull requests so that you can leave any additions/improvements to the other
instead of running it in .zipper on other channels since then the info becomes hard to find.

Don't touch the JSON unless you are sure/that you understand how python works. ALWAYS update the JSON "done" field after adding
of the questions. To start the script locally, just have python and download flask (pip install flask from the command line).

To start the app: python complements_biometry.py (in the folder where the file is).
Then browse with the localhost:999 browser.

P.S. There is also the repo for biometric systems applications. It is identical as a project but with a different JSON.
P.P.S. Leave a greeting for those who will read this file after you :)
